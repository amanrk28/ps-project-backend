# Provision Store Project ( MYMSME )

Provision store Project is made to help local shopkeepers expand their customer base to more than just a locality. 

## Basic Scenario
Any local store owner can upload their products and its details on this platform and people can come here to purchase these products like an e-commerce app. After customer makes a puchase, we take care of payments, store pickup and doorstep delivery with minimal service charges based only on the profit gained by said store owner.

2.  Clone the code to your system by running ```git clone git@github.com:Provision-Store-Project/ps-project-backend.git``` in your terminal at desired location.
3.  Make sure you have python, pip and pipenv installed in your system globally.
4.  Move to backend folder by ```cd ps-project-backend``` and then run ```pipenv shell``` in terminal to start virtual environment.
5.  To start the server, run ```make server``` in terminal. The server will be running at http://127.0.0.1:8000/
6.  To start coding using VS Code, run ```code .``` in terminal at the file location.
